This is a coding challenge from [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-huffman) by John Crickett.

This is an implementation of Huffman Coding from (almost) scratch.

I have used DFS to create the Huffman codes once the tree has been create. Also I used simple tree traversal to traverse through the tree.

Special thanks to the creator of this [repo](https://github.com/Perchinka/ownCompress) as it helped me to read and write binary to files.
